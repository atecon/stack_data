This package delivers functions for "un-stacking" a panel data set, and for stacking a time-series data set.

The unstack() function has no built-in gretl counterpart. Ths function isolates the unit-specific time-series of a panel data set with k units into separate columns of a matrix.

Since gretl version 2020b, the built-in stack() function has got new cool features, namely the "offset" and "n" parameters (see for details: http://gretl.sourceforge.net/gretl-help/funcref.html#stack).

The stack_data() function proposed here, however, may still be helpful for some applications. First, it can be applied within both a loop-block and a function-block, respectively. While the built-in stack() function can be applied in a loop-block since gretl version 2020b, it is not applicable within a function-block as the dimension of the data set cannot be changed by a some statement within a function-block.

The stack_data() does its operation not in-memory but rather stores the stacked data set in a separate data file. It simply stacks k series (each of length T) vertically, and adds the two identifier series: (1) 'unit_id' (unique integer identifying each of the k series) and (2) 'obs_id' (running number referring to each of T observations). Both, 'unit_id' and 'obs_id' may be helpful in case the user wants to define the stacked data as a panel data set, and/ or join another data set by means of gretl's built-in 'join' command.

The stack_matdata(), in contrast, does its operation in-memory and returns a matrix to the user instead. This may be useful if you operate with large data sets.

Please ask questions and report bugs on the gretl mailing list if possible.

PUBLIC FUNCTIONS
=================

stack_data(L, filename, series_name, series_description):
=========================================================
Vertically stack data of list L into a single series and store the
resulting series. The returned matrix includes three series: (1) "unit_id"
is a numeric identifier referring to the i-th stacked series, (2) "obs_id"
is a unit-specific running number from 1 to T identifier, and (3) the
stacked series itself.

Arguments:
L               - list, List of series to stack
filename        - string, Full path plus filename where to store data set
series_name     - string, Name of compiled series (optional, default:
                  "stacked_series")
series_description	- string, Set the variable's descriptive label
                      (optional, default: "")

Return:
If the stacked data set is successfully stored, return 0, 1 otherwise.


stack_matdata(L, series_name[null]):
====================================
Works as the stack_data() function but returns a matrix instead. The
matrix comprises three columns: (1) "unit_id" is an index referring
to the i-th stacked series, (2) "obs_id" is a unit-specific running number
from 1 to T (observations) index, and (3) the stacked series itself.

Arguments:
L               - list, List of series to stack
series_name     - string, Name of compiled series (optional, default:
                  "stacked_series")

Return:
Non-empty matrix on success, otherwise empty matrix.


unstack(x, series_name[null], names_array[null]):
=================================================
Works only for panel-data. For a panel with k units and T unit-specific
observations, series x is reshaped to a T by (1+k) matrix. The first
column refers to the observational index, while the remaining columns
refer to grouped values of x.

The columns of the resulting matrix may include labels if either (i) a string-valued series 'series_names' or (ii) a string array with k
elements is provided. If both 'series_names' and 'names_array' are
provided and are valid inputs, 'series_names' dominates.

Arguments:
x               - series, Series to unstack
series_names    - series, String-valued series of unit names (optional)
names_array     - strings, Array of names for each panel unit (optional).

Return:
Matrix of dimension T by (1 + k).
